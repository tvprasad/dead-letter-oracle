![Dead Letter Oracle](docs/poster.png)

Dead Letter Oracle is an MCP-based agent that analyzes failed dead-letter queue messages, explains root causes, proposes and simulates fixes, and makes governed replay decisions — with a full reasoning trace.

---

## Problem

In event-driven systems, failed messages require manual debugging:

- Root cause is unclear from the error alone
- Schema mismatches are hard to diagnose without tooling
- Replay decisions are made without confidence scoring or governance

---

## Solution

Dead Letter Oracle automates the full incident loop:

1. Reads the failed DLQ message via `dlq.read_message`
2. Validates the payload via `schema.validate`
3. LLM proposes an initial fix (high-level direction)
4. `replay.simulate` tests the fix — returns confidence score
5. If confidence is low, LLM revises with a concrete, operational fix
6. `replay.simulate` re-evaluates the revised fix
7. Gatekeeper issues ALLOW / WARN / BLOCK with multi-factor reasoning
8. BlackBox renders the full 7-step reasoning trace

---

## Architecture

```
User → CLI → Agent Runtime
                ├── MCP Client ── stdio ── MCP Server
                │                              ├── dlq.read_message
                │                              ├── schema.validate
                │                              └── replay.simulate
                ├── LLM  (propose → simulate → revise)
                ├── Gatekeeper  (ALLOW / WARN / BLOCK)
                └── BlackBox    (reasoning trace)
```

The MCP protocol boundary is real — the agent and server run as separate processes communicating over stdio. Tools are deterministic. The LLM is the interpretation layer only.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# fill in LLM credentials (see .env.example)
python main.py
```

### LLM Provider

Set `LLM_PROVIDER` in `.env`:

| Value | Required vars |
|-------|--------------|
| `azure_openai` (default) | `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` |
| `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` |
| `ollama` | `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, `OLLAMA_MODEL` |

> Tested with Ollama (llama3) for local and air-gapped deployment — relevant for enterprise and federal environments where cloud API calls are restricted.

### Running tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Input | Output |
|------|-------|--------|
| `dlq.read_message` | `file_path` | Parsed DLQ message |
| `schema.validate` | `payload`, `expected_schema` | `valid`, `errors[]` |
| `replay.simulate` | `original_message`, `proposed_fix` | `confidence`, `success_likelihood`, `reason` |

---

## Gatekeeper Factors

Multi-factor evaluation — not a simple if/else:

- **Schema** — mismatch detected / resolved
- **Simulation** — confidence score from `replay.simulate`
- **Fix** — whether a confirmed fix was applied
- **Environment** — prod requires higher confidence threshold

## Project Structure

```
mcp_server/      MCP server + tools (deterministic)
agent/           Agent runtime, planner, LLM integration
governance/      Gatekeeper — multi-factor replay evaluation
observability/   BlackBox — structured reasoning trace
data/            Sample DLQ message (local, no Kafka)
adr/             Architecture Decision Records (ADR-001–007)
tests/           22 unit + integration tests
docs/            Architecture poster (poster.png)
prompts/         Phased build prompts (ADR-driven)
```

## Hackathon Context

Developed during the AI Hackathon submission period (Feb 2 – Apr 3, 2026).

Built ADR-first: each phase locked decisions before implementation. The deliberate first-fix failure (confidence 0.28 → 0.91) is the core demo moment — it proves the agent reasons, not just formats.
